# Iagon Network Explorer

<br/>

## Overview

Iagon Network Explorer V1 is slated to become a decentralized network comprising nodes, facilitating communication with the Cardano partnerchain. A Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) node will be established, observable from various chains. Compute-intensive tasks will be allocated to diverse Substrate instances, and explorer nodes will replace databases.

By harnessing IOG’s partner chain framework, based on Polkadot's Substrate SDK, we aim to construct a network of decentralized nodes on Substrate infrastructure, capable of interfacing with Cardano and other chains and managing Iagon’s compute-intensive operations.

This substrate-based chain represents a comprehensive decentralized enhancement to an existing storage solution. It aims to support decentralized file indexing and on-chain transaction monitoring in the long term. In our current development phase, we are focusing on building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a Cardano partnerchain. This includes various types of nodes such as uploader/sharding nodes and storage nodes.

Each of these nodes will connect to a full substrate node, referred to as IAG DLT, responsible for maintaining the network state, block creation, and validation. Additionally, archive nodes will serve as indexer nodes within the network, tracking all transactions without any associated fees. These components collectively form a fully decentralized system with on-chain data indexing and automatic shard synchronization.

Furthermore, all network transactions will be accessible for monitoring through an explorer link connected to the archive node.

## Objectives

### Establish a Cardano Partnerchain Network

- Build a partnerchain infrastructure as the foundation for decentralized nodes, enabling interoperability and future scalability of Iagon's networks.

### Enhance Decentralized Operations

- Replace traditional databases with explorer nodes for file indexing and on-chain transaction monitoring.

- Introduce uploader/sharding, storage, and archive nodes to manage network states, validate blocks, and index data efficiently.


### Enable Interoperability with Cardano and Beyond

- Design the Substrate-based chain for seamless integration with Cardano partnerchains and other blockchain ecosystems.

- Facilitate cost-effective, transparent, and scalable operations for decentralized computing and storage.

### Promote Community Engagement and Open-Source Development

- Share research, development, and technical documentation openly to reduce R&D time for other projects.

- Provide SDKs and a GitHub repository to encourage collaboration and the development of partnerchains.
